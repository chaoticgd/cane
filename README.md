To-be Sly cooper level editor

Until I make a cmake thing for this, here's how to build:

change the project files so it includes the source directory, as well as the following components:

  * [glfw](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
  * [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
  * opengl (you probably have it already in like system32 or whatever)
  * [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
